Once upon a time , in a forest, there was a monkey
who resided on berry tree.
which was on the bank of the river.
In the same forest, there were crocodile and crocodile's wife
One day crocodile came to banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kindhearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
As day passed by, the crocodile and monkey became good friends.
